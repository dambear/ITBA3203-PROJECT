## INTRODUCTION

 In the Philippines, dengue is probably the most well-known and feared tropical disease. The first recorded dengue epidemic in Southeast Asia occurred in Manila in 1954, and dengue has since remained endemic.[1] In 2019, 437,563 cases were recorded in the Philippines, contributing to the highest dengue cases ever recorded globally.[2]
To address this growing problem, the Philippine government established the National Dengue Prevention and Control Program in 1993.[3,4] The program consists of case and vector surveillance, case diagnosis and management, integrated vector management, outbreak response, health promotion and advocacy, and research. The Department of Health has been focusing on environmental control measures, reminding citizens to make the “4 o'clock habit”, which involves emptying water containers which are potential Aedes breeding sites everyday, and some chemical control measures (fogging during outbreaks) in its campaigns.
However, the program has struggled to meet its goals of dengue reduction.[2,3] One significant barrier to its success is the lack of empowerment among the stakeholders in taking responsibility for dengue prevention. Another problem encountered was the challenge of eradicating local breeding sites, which are primarily water-holding containers. In areas with unreliable piped water, residents store water in such containers. Further, miscellaneous containers are commonly kept by residents as these can be used for other purposes or even sold for income. Lastly, inefficient garbage collection services may result in scattered trash that can accumulate rainwater.
In 2016, the Dengvaxia vaccine was introduced as part of the country's dengue prevention efforts. [5] Unfortunately, nearly two years after the campaign started, Sanofi, the vaccine developer, announced that Dengvaxia might cause ‘more severe disease’ in those who have not had previous dengue infection. By this time, over 800,000 children had been indiscriminately inoculated, and public outrage ensued, with lawsuits filed against Sanofi and various government officials due to claims of children's deaths from the vaccine and government corruption. The resulting mistrust against the public health sector plunged immunization rates, precipitating a measles outbreak in 2019.

As part of the Sustainable Development Goals, WHO will propose new dengue-specific goals for 2030. The 2030 goals provide an opportunity for focused action on tackling dengue burden but should be carefully developed to be ambitious but also technically feasible. Here we discuss the potential for clearly defined case fatality rates and the rollout of new and effective intervention technologies to form the foundation of these future goals. Further, we highlight how the complexity of dengue epidemiology limits the feasibility of goals that instead target dengue outbreaks.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

Philippines is experiencing a severe dengue epidemic, It is evident that natural variation alone cannot account for the significant shift observed in dengue cases,.The consequences of the current dengue outbreak pose immense challenges to both society and the environment, demanding proactive adaptation planning for long-term growth.


Dengue cases in the Philippines are further compounded by the country's vulnerability to climate change. As stated by the World Bank (2013), the Philippines frequently faces typhoons, droughts, sea-level rise, and tsunamis, which exacerbate the impact of dengue outbreaks. These natural disasters put strain on crucial resources and hinder agricultural growth and productivity. In order to ensure high crop yields and plant growth, maintaining a balanced soil, water, and air environment at the root zone is essential.

Addressing the dengue epidemic in the Philippines is crucial due to the local and global implications of climate change. Climate change is a global phenomenon with various local repercussions, posing significant challenges that require long-term planning and policy responses beyond the usual human lifetime and political horizon. While traditional adaptation planning has mainly focused on the regional level, the importance of local adaptation has grown in the past decade.

The Philippines' climate, characterized by high temperatures and abundant rainfall in the humid tropical environment, provides favorable conditions for dengue transmission. However, the country's heavy reliance on climate-sensitive economic activities, such as agriculture, leaves it ill-equipped for effective adaptation. Limited social and financial resources make developing countries like the Philippines more susceptible to the impacts of climate change. The burden of climate change's effects, particularly on sustainable development, is likely to fall heavily on vulnerable groups, including the youth.

As one of the most vulnerable countries globally, the Philippines is committed to addressing the dengue epidemic. The government has established robust legislative and administrative structures to achieve national development goals and fulfill international obligations for climate prevention and adaptation. Integration of climate change prevention and catastrophic risk reduction activities into the Philippine Development Plan from 2017 to 2022 underscores the urgent need for comprehensive adaptation strategies to combat the dengue crisis effectively.

## SIGNIFICANT OF THE PROPOSE PROJECT

Dengue fever has been a significant public health concern in the Philippines for many years. The country experiences frequent outbreaks of dengue, particularly during the rainy season when mosquito populations thrive. The effects of dengue in the Philippines can be significant and have a considerable impact on public health and the affected individuals. The Department of Health (DOH) in the Philippines is responsible for monitoring and reporting dengue cases.  

## METHODS

To gain a deeper understanding of the impact of climate change on dengue cases in the Philippines from 2016 to 2020, an empirical research approach will be employed. This research will involve conducting a thorough literature review to gather existing knowledge on climate change, dengue, and adaptation strategies in the Philippines. Additionally, data on dengue cases will be compiled from reliable sources, such as the Department of Health, to analyze trends and patterns over the specified period.

## EXPECTED OUTPUT

The expected output of this research project on dengue cases in the Philippines from 2016 to 2020 is to identify general patterns and trends in the data, enabling the researcher to make informed assessments. By analyzing the relationship between variables and observing any worsening trends, this analysis can contribute to raising awareness about the factors contributing to climate change and its impact on dengue transmission. The findings can be utilized to advocate for measures that reduce these variables and address climate change effectively.

Overall, the expected output of this research is to provide valuable information and evidence that can guide decision-making processes, shape policies, and contribute to the development of effective strategies to address dengue cases in the Philippines in the context of climate change.
